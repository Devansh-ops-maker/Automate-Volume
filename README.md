# Automate-Volume
This project will help us to control volume by hands.
The volume is controlled by the x coordinates of our index finger.
The range of the volume is between 0 and 100.
The project is written in python language and basic libraries like Pycaw , OpenCV and Mediapipe are used.
OpenCV helped in video capture and processing.
Mediapipe helped in landmark capturing and real-time hand detection.
pycaw controls system audio.
comtypes is a dependency for pycaw to interact with Windows' audio devices.
